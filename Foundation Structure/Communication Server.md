# Boom-Technologies - Communication Server

----------------------------------------------------------

[Please refer to this document to get information regarding entering the communication server and learning about its regulations!](https://github.com/LinearValues/Boom-Technologies/blob/information/Regulations/Communication%20Server%20Regulations.md)

The server contains a separate moderation department, so don't ask the foundation executives about server moderation in the communication server; however, if a situation gets severe- then please ask the highest ranked executive online at the time. They may be able to deal with server moderation! 

Please note that panalties received from the communications server may transfer over to the foundation, so be careful of what you say in the communications server because it may very well get you removed from the foundation!
