# Boom-Technologies

## Foundation Lore
Among the many advancements that humanity has made throughout the millenniums come the most revolutionizing scientific innovations: from the first-ever form of energy-powered transportation, to ways of communicating around-the-world with other individuals. One individual might instigate the following: what will be the next revolutionizing discovery? This is where the Boom Technologies foundation comes into play. Founded by the United Nations with several locations spreading alongside the coastlines of the United Kingdom and Canadian Territories, the Boom Technologies foundation is a non-profit organization towards the advancement of the human race and modern technology. The primary purpose of the foundation is to propose new technological ideas to the word that one may think would come from only a science-fiction franchise. The foundation is comprised of multiple divisions to maintain foundation operations and structure. The main goal of these divisions is to uphold  the foundational facilities and overall foundation structure. As we say to all of our visiting associates and upcoming employees, welcome to the foundation!
