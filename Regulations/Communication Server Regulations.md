## ยง1 | Communication Server Regulations 
As with any foundation, there are guidelines that all members must follow when engaging in communication with one-another. These guidelines are put into place to keep the foundation's communication server civility intact. These guidelines, which can also be called regulations, are to to uphold the community's environment and reputation as well as keep the community from going into utter chaos. These guidelines are enforced by the foundation's and the communication server's executives. These guidelines follow the moderate rehabilitation system, in which members are subject to be disciplined whenever they break said regulation. With the introduction to the guidelines being instated, here are the guidelines that all members, including executives, must follow:
1. All controverisal, dramatic, conflicting, political, or otherwise toxic topics are to be discussed in participating members' direct messages as to prevent controversial topics inside of the server. This will result in a redirection to the participating members' direct messages if this regulation is broken. If the offender persists, then they will be warned for officially breaking this regulation.
