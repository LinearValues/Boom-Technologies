## §1 | General Regulations 
As with any other organizations, there are also rules to follow. Regulations are put into place to prevent the bad apples from being able to ruin the experience for others through their immoral deeds. These regulations are often enforced by the executives- or the divisions’ high ranking members if it is occuring inside a division’s game. These regulations are meant to uphold the foundation’s community. WIth that being stated, here are the regulations that all foundation members much follow in order to remain in a good standing in terms of community administration:
1. Abusing in any sense, whether it is through administrative powers or by using tools, is prohibited. Abuse of these permissions or tools will result in them being temporarily or permanently stripped depending on the severity of the abuse and the discretion of the moderator.
2. Abusing guns will result in being temporarily placed on a security Arrest-on-Sight order. This means that you will be shot at if you provoke personnel on site in a harassment tone. If you mass kill or kill individuals at the spawn, you will be placed on a permanent security Kill-on-Sight in which security will shoot at you once they spot you. You can also be temporarily banned based on the severity. 
3. Threatening, harassing, or otherwise neglecting fellow peers inside of the foundation or on site will result in you being verbally warned by the foundation executives.
4. Spamming will result in you being muted by the concurrent online group executives. Spamming is when you send at least 5 or more messages within a short time span, usually a second.
5. Participating in an unallowed and non-divisional raid will result in you being temporarily banned by the group executives.
6. Asking for online currency such as Robux or Bitcoin will result in you being verbally warned or potentially muted if you continue to do so afterwards.
7. Please refrain from posting your login credentials in the group. You will not be penalized for it; however, the message you send will be deleted and you can get a verbal warning based on the spam regulation.
8. The misuse or abuse of given permissions will result in them being taken away.
8. Sending malicious content will result in a permanent foundation ban. This ranges from explicit imagery to exploits such as cookie loggers.
9. Please respect everyone in this group. This especially goes towards staff individuals inside of the group as they are expected to respect their lower ranked peers If a staff member asks you to stop doing something that you shouldn’t be doing, then you should stop. Everybody in the group should respect each-other, if you don’t follow this regulation then you will be verbally warned.
10. The main communication server regulations apply to all of the divisional communication servers. These regulations also apply to those servers.
11. The use of derogatory language, causing conflict, or otherwise being toxic in the group will result in a verbal warning.
